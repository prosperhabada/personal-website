Hello! I'm Prosper, an educator and computer engineer based in Accra, Ghana who enjoys teaching and building things that live on the internet. I tinker arduinos and the raspberry pi when I have the time to spare. I love the feeling of floating on the water and feeling almost weightless... j'adore la natation.

I graduated with a Bsc in Computer Engineering from [Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology](https://www.knust.edu.gh/), I joined the IT team at [Tema Oil Refinery](https://www.tor.com.gh/) where I worked on a variety of interesting and meaningful projects on a daily basis. Shortly after, I am currently teaching at [SOS-Hermann Gmeiner International College](https://www.soshgic.edu.gh/) in the role of Head of ICT Department.

Here are a few tech stacks I've been working with recently:
