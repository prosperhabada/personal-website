Hello! I'm Prosper, an educator and computer engineer based in Accra, Ghana who enjoys teaching and building things that live on the internet. I tinker arduinos and the raspberry pi when I have the time to spare. I love the feeling of floating on the water and feeling almost weightless... j'adore la natation.

# I graduated with a Bsc in Computer Engineering from [Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology](https://www.knust.edu.gh/), I joined the IT team at [Tema Oil Refinery](https://www.tor.com.gh/) where I worked on a variety of interesting and meaningful projects on a daily basis. Shortly after, I am currently teaching at [SOS-Hermann Gmeiner International College](https://www.soshgic.edu.gh/) in the role of Head of ICT Department.

Hello! I'm Prosper, an educator and computer engineer based in Accra, Ghana who enjoys teaching and building things that live on the internet. I occasionally develop websites and web apps from my startup [Vivisoft Ghana](https://www.vivisoftghana.com/) with the vision of promoting ghanaian businesses & companies online. When I have the time to spare, I do tinker Arduinos, Raspberry pi or even electronics. I'm 27 and still single... I love the feeling of floating on the water and feeling almost weightless... j'adore la natation.
