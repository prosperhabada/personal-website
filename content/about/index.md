Hello! I'm Prosper, an educator and computer engineer based in Accra, Ghana who enjoys teaching and building things that live on the internet. I develop exceptional websites and web apps from my startup [Vivisoft Ghana](https://www.vivisoftghana.com/) and do tinker arduinos, raspberry pi or electronics when I have the time to spare. I love the feeling of floating on the water and feeling almost weightless.

I graduated with a Bsc in Computer Engineering from [Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology](https://www.knust.edu.gh/), I joined the IT team at [Tema Oil Refinery](https://www.tor.com.gh/) where I worked on a variety of interesting and meaningful projects on a daily basis. Shortly after, I engaged my life-long passion of teaching at [SOS-Hermann Gmeiner International College](https://www.soshgic.edu.gh/) as Head of IT Department

Here are a few technologies I've been working with recently:
