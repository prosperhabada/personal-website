"If you want to change the world, change Education" - Nelson Mandela

I'm an educator and computer engineer currently based in Canada, who enjoys teaching and building projects that live on the internet. I tinker arduinos and the raspberry pi when I have the time to spare. I love the feeling of floating on water and feeling almost weightless... j'adore la natation.

I graduated with a Bsc in Computer Engineering from [Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology](https://www.knust.edu.gh/), I joined the IT team at [Tema Oil Refinery](https://torghana.gov.gh/) where I worked on a variety of interesting and meaningful projects on a daily basis. Shortly after, I engaged a life-long passion of teaching at [SOS-Hermann Gmeiner International College](https://www.soshgic.edu.gh/).

I'm currently pursuing my Master's Degree in Education, Leadership in Learning - Global Perspective focus at the [University of Prince Edward Island](https://www.upei.ca/) in Canada.

Here are a few tech stacks I've worked with:
